==========================

This is very simple Asterisk resource module for persistent pushing every Asterisk AMI 
event into an arbitrary client via Zero MQ (tm) library interface.


For instance, one might find it useful to couple given module with Ratchet PHP WS 
library to provide Asterisk administrator with useful information about of the PBX
- that will be realised by pushing monitoring events via web interface web sockets 
technology.

==========================

Legend

==========================

Keeping persistent connection with Asterisk Manager Interface might be not desirable 
in all possible situations, especially in natted envionment where web GUI physically located
on a different machine from that of the PBX server.

Installation Guide

==========================

1. Asterisk source tree must be deployed in some accessable directory.
2. Invoke included install.sh file from a system user with write  permissions to 
   /etc/asterisk and asterisk source tree path.

$ sh ./install.sh


libzmq:

At some point of the installation process you will be prompted whether you want 
to install libzmq library. Beware, this choice might be on your discretion, 
however installing library available through your operating system's distribution 
repository might lead to undesirable consequences - commonly repository offers 
outdated versions of the libraries, the softlinks created will required effort to
remove. Better option is to agree with the program installer and proceed with 
installation from source code. Please take into account that development-tools
and libtool are required for script to build libzmq library from source code. 
Git is required to download its source tree. In either case libzmq version 3 
is the minimum requiredment for the presented module to work properly.


==========================

Configuration

==========================

Only one configuration parameter thus far available in configuration file 
that should be installed by the installer script - that is the destination's 
unified resource location also known as uri location of the listening server.

[general]
uri = tcp://127.0.0.1:5555


==========================

Known limitations

==========================

The underlying concept implying one way communication - events are being pushed 
with no way to issue commands to Asterisk - to do that you might need to 
initiate Asterisk Manager connection on your own.
